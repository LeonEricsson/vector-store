# vector-store
a minimal vector storage in numpy. 

build your index of documents and query it using cosine, euclidean or manhattan similarity. 

```
python3 test.py
```

so, does it scale? no. 

<div align="center">
  <img src="/data/img.png" width="50%">
</div>

but if your application doesn't need more than a couple hundred thousand entries, why make things more
complicated than they needs to be?
